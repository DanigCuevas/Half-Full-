<h2> Duaa Zaheer </h2>
<p> I'm a current senior at the International Community School. My experience in Girls who Code has been an amazing opportunity to explore different aspects of Computer Science and how we can use technology to empower youth and help others in our community. I plan on majoring in Computer Science in college. In school, I enjoy competing in FBLA and Mock Trial, and serve as National Honor Society President. Outside of school, I enjoy coding and also run a non-profit called WYSEQ that hosts annual leadership conferences at the University of Washington. </p>

<h2> Taylor Caragher </h2>
<p> Currently heading into my senior year at the International Community School, I've had the opportunity to explore a number of different passions and areas of interest during my high school career. Making short films, developing websites, and giving presentations are just a few of the activities I enjoy the most. In school, I'm president of my school's Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) chapter, an executive for a student-mentoring program, and a member of National Arts Honor Society (NAHS). Blending the arts and the sciences has always been a big fascination of mine, and my time at Girls Who Code this summer has certainly enhanced this! </p>

<h2> Ladan Farah </h2>
<p> I'm going to be a senior at Lindbergh High School in the upcoming school year, 2018-2019. I'm apart of multiple different activities at my school, including FBLA, HOSA, Black and Brown Girls Summit, and International Club. This summer at Girls Who Code has been my first involvement in computer science/ coding and I've really enjoyed it. I'm definitely considering pursuing it as a career. </p>

<h2> Daniela Cuevas </h2>
<p>I'm an incoming junior at Kentwood High School and Running Start student at Green River Community college. In my free time you can find me doodling, journaling, running, or just doing something creative. During school I'm part of National Honor Society, and a current Cross Country captain. I'm hoping to join Key Club and GWC club this year as well. I've been taking part in Girls Who Code this summer, which has brought me a wider perspective on the whole meaning of being in computer science . I hope in the future I can partake in more projects involving Computer Science and become another woman in technology.</p>
