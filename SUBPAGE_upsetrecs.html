<p class = "centerText"> 1. EXCERCISE: Physical activity is key in releasing your anger and tension. Go on a quick run, do some stretches or play outside for a bit. <br> 2. WAIT: Waiting for a bit and getting into the right headspace before expressing your anger can be extremely helpful. Calmly expressing your concerns is always better than saying something when you're not thinking clearly. <br> 3. 'I' STATEMENTS: Stick to using 'I' statements when you're expressing your frustration. This can help to avoid criticizing and placing blame, which will only create more tension. </p>
